# MCU Samples
These are sample projects for MCU boards that I have. These are organized by silicon vendor, board, then project. I am not making any attempts here to have projects compile across boards. The same project may exist multiple times for different boards with no code sharing. The aim is to have some things that are known to work for specific targets.

I will capture the origin of the projects in readmes specific to them. These are originating from silicon vendor tools, SDKs, and other guides. I am making modifications to them primarily so I can get them running in VS Code.

To use the projects open the project folder itself in VS Code, not the root of the repo.
